<p>The language of the totalist environment is characterized by
the thought-terminating cliche. The most far-reaching and complex
of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive,
definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed.
These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Lifton in his work &lsquo;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of Brainwashing in China&rsquo; coined the phrase <em>thought-terminating cliche</em> to
define a phenomenon within Totalist ideologies that aim to reduce complex issues down to a memorable, reductive, yet decisive sounding phrase. Lifton refers to
Richard Weaver&rsquo;s concept of <em>ultimate terms</em> which represent either the ultimate good or the ultimate bad - these terms immediately signal an association of
ideas or thoughts with good and evil. To call something bourgeois is at once to tacitly call it evil and therefore, according to leftist Totalist doctrine,
unacceptable.</p>
<p>We see here a pattern of characteristics among Totalist language:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stripping of nuance in favour of dichotomy.</li>
<li>Discursive reasoning supplanted by and confined to ideological boundaries.</li>
<li>The elimination of critical thought that may threaten ideological totality or conformity.</li>
<li>Categorisation of desirable and undesirable objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another kind of quality to the thought-terminating cliche and that is one of assumed authority. To give some examples look at the following
thought-terminating cliches from our own period:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Believe the Science&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Believe women&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Trans rights are human rights&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Educate yourself&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do your research&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;The wrong side of history&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do better&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may notice that these all (though not necessarily all thought-terminating cliches), in some way or another, imply the backing of an authority. They all imply that if you disagree or, at least, critique the principles of the Totalist
ideology then you are invariably coming up against the authority of science, the law, morality itself or even history; Authority has been subtly monopolised. Such examples also tacitly imply
a reaction if your intolerable thought continues - that is, you will face the wrath of the law; the chastisement of your peers for your immorality; or branded an anti-intellectual. We see here that
Richard Weaver&rsquo;s ultimate terms are threaded within and around these loaded terms.</p>
<p>It is worth further noting that the truth or falsity of a thought-terminating cliche is not in question. The sentiment and point behind a thought-terminating cliche may be perfectly fine (&ldquo;Do as the doctor says&rdquo;
is perfectly good advice but still classifies). The key characteristics of the thought-terminating cliche is stated quite clearly: it terminates thoughts. That is, it prevents a further
line of questioning - it is agnostic as to the veracity of this line of questioning. The reason for this is quite simple: thought terminating-cliches are concerned with ideological purity and not truth, but
even the most Totalist of ideologies are bound to have nuggets of truth in them where free enterprise of the mind would lead one soundly to acceptance of such a nugget. However, Totalist ideologies
are no more comfortable with you questioning their hard-hitting truths than the are with questioning their more dubious propositions; elimination of critical thought entirely is the goal.</p>
<p>Now, thought-terminating cliches are prevalent throughout all of life across all ideologies: &ldquo;it is what it is&rdquo;; &ldquo;God works in mysterious ways&rdquo;; &ldquo;easy come easy go&rdquo;; &ldquo;National security&rdquo;; &ldquo;No child left behind&rdquo;, etc.
So it is not as if left-wing ideologies have a monopoly on such language, but there is a uniqueness to left-wing ideologies that makes such language manifest more readily and typically more dangerously:
communality, revolutionary sentiment and a sense of moral self-approval.</p>
<p>Whereas the leftist views society as a commune or one that ought to be a commune where class is largely abolished or where everybody operates under a form of equity the non-leftist operates on much more demarcated notions.
The non-leftist leaves politics at the door of family, God, country, home, the market, etc. Leftism, however, is almost inherently Totalist under the influence of Marx; even for non-marxist leftists. It is from
Marx that leftists adopt their revolutionary sentiment which now manifests largely in a digital form of pharmakos, mass protests and boycotts. The charge of moral self-approval may seem harsh, but it is also not
without merit as leftists tend to hold the view that history is tending towards their desired destination where pursuit of that end-goal permits immoral acts and those leftists that don&rsquo;t accept this end-goal will,
these days, be wrapped up in Foucauldian notions of power structures where what is right and what is wrong is merely based on the whims of those who possess power.</p>
<p>It is no surprise then that in Nineteen-Eighty-Four the Party is of the Stalinist variety of totalitarian. Not because Orwell was critiquing Stalinism (which he was) but because it couldn&rsquo;t be anything other than a left-wing
form of totalitarianism. Totalism occurs in other totalitarian regimes of course, including non-leftist states like Nazi Germany, but such regimes tend to have little need for such linguistic manipulation. The non-leftist
totalitarian state is not so much interested in conformity as it is with complicity. The Nazis could not care less whether the typical German believed in the ideals of the Nazi regime so long as they were willing to begrudgingly and quietly participate. This is not to say the non-leftist totalitarian state doesn&rsquo;t aim to control language - it certainly does, but it aims to control it in a way that prevents publication and spread of resistance and not so much
the control of the individuals private thoughts. This is not the same for left-wing ideologies which are Totalist in the truest sense: they seek not just your complicity, but your willing conformity; not just your cooperation
but your enthusiastic participation. They know voluntary universal cooperation is not possibles and so they seek to impose &lsquo;willing&rsquo; cooperation by making it impossible for you to consider any other alternative. It is why Newspeak
attempts to eliminate seditious thought by making it literally impossible by elimination of the language that would make it possible. Such is the aim of the thought-terminating cliche.</p>
<p>The robber Baron is better than the man who torments you for your own sake, said C.S. Lewis, for the robber Baron can be satiated, but those who torment you with the approval of their own conscience
never rest. This, in effect, is what distinguishes non-left and leftist Totalism. There is, however, a potential turning-tide in the recent decade as the old economic line between left and right blurs.
In America we have seen the rise of Trumpism which operates almost wholly on thought-terminating cliches, reductons and superlatives: &ldquo;Make America great again&rdquo; is a thought-terminating cliche and perhaps the most
successful example in recent memory. The recent actions of the Trump administration (breaking court rulings, arresting judges, pressuring businesses and universities) indicate a kind of desire for
ideological uniformity that conforms and doesn&rsquo;t just merely comply. It&rsquo;s quickly becoming apparent that it may have just been that the left-wing ideologies were ahead of the curve in this sense.</p>
