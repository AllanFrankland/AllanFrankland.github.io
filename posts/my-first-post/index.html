<p>By supporting work that somebody like J.K Rowling may profit from you are directly supporting the harm she causes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is what I read by some unsignificant person this morning. This isn&rsquo;t my first time coming accross such a notion as its appearance
comes in all shapes and forms but the general logic is that one must avoid supporting those who themselves support, actually or not,
causes or ideas that are intolerable. I was more alert to this notion in this instance as it applied to individuals - not just
corporate entities or political parties, but an individual person.</p>
<p>To what degree is this notion reasonable? To what degree is it sensible? I suppose in some sense it&rsquo;s quite reasonable and quite
sensible. After all would you support that you knew was intending on seeking your own demise, but that&rsquo;s an association
between persons, individuals. The notion we&rsquo;re dealing with here is much more abstract and concerns people who do not know us.
We are, it seems, really dealing with a sort of <em>pharmakos</em> aimed at ideological catharsis.</p>
<p>I say that, because it seems immediately apparent that such a purity test of individuals is effectively impossible. One cannot
run every artist, public figure, celebrity, friend or co-worker through a function to see if they come out the other end
acceptable to the ideologue. What is more if one was to apply this test to themselves they would, if being honest, almost
certainly find themselves</p>
