<blockquote>
<p>For Aristotle, the evolution of human culture is in large part the evolution of <em>technê</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>We must point out that poetry, here, does not necessarily refer to what we today think of as literature in verse. The word used by Aristotle is ποιητής (pi.i’tis) which translates to &lsquo;work&rsquo; or &lsquo;creation&rsquo; - this word is used to describe all those products of language from verse to prose to lyric poetry and even treatises of philosophy and science.  For Aristotle mimetic works also include music and painting. I agree with Malcom Heath who defends his translation of &lsquo;mimesis&rsquo; to mean imitation rather than representation as&ndash;he puts it&ndash;the term representation fails to capture the subtle meaning behind Aristotle&rsquo;s use of mimesis; the eagle is a symbol used to <em>represent</em> Zeus, but it is by no means an imitation in the way that the statue on Olympia would have been. Representations then are wholly conventional whereas mimesis is much more concerned with a kind of accurate reflection and, as Aristotle says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We take delight in viewing the most accurate possible images of objects&hellip;</p></blockquote>
<p>Stephen Halliwell disagrees and prefers to use of representation as a translation for mimesis</p>
<blockquote>
<p>because the English usage of this word (and cognate forms) comes closest to the range of meanings covered by the mimesis word-group in Greek. Thus a picture can represent a subject, an actor represent a character, a play represent an action, event or story (&lsquo;imitate&rsquo; has none of these senses in modern English), and in each of these cases Greek can similarly use the mimesis family of words.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find myself disagreeing with Halliwell and prefer &lsquo;imitation&rsquo; and I find myself somewhat puzzled by his claim that &lsquo;imitate&rsquo; carries none of the associations that &lsquo;represent&rsquo; would. Taking the dictionary definitions of &lsquo;represent&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To depict, portray.</p></blockquote>
<p>and &lsquo;imitate&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do or try to do after the manner of; to follow the example of; to copy in action.</p></blockquote>
<p>In these senses I follow &lsquo;imitation&rsquo; if for no other reason than it seems to fit best in Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of genus and species. When one acts as a human does one does so in the manner of a human, you do not depict a human, you embody a human. Likewise Homer did not merely attempt to depict the wrath of Achilles but attempted to embody it - in a very artsy sense - or, rather, he attempted to have the audience embody Achilles&rsquo; wrath first as a enraged participant and secondly as a horrified onlooker. When one reads a enchanting work of literature or witnesses a bewitching display of theatre you do not feel as though you are merely witnessing a depiction or portrayal rather you feel completely engrossed, the senses are duped, what is happening is really happening, the grief or elation you feel is real. Just as the best imitation of somebodies accent will fool even the most familiar ear so too do mimetic works.</p>
<p>My choice for preferring to understand mimesis in this way is riddled with objections, but as far as I am concerned the point of mimetic works is to reach that ideal of complete engrossment. Most fall far below it, of course, but are no less mimetic in their nature, but it is not for those works I endeavour to read <em>Poetics</em>.</p>

  The Elements of Mimetic Works
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-elements-of-mimetic-works">#</a>
</h1>
<p>To begin, Aristotle begins with the supposition that all mimetic<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> works can be distinguished by three components: <em>medium, object</em> and <em>mode</em>.</p>
<p>It is here we get Aristotle&rsquo;s understanding of poetry as chiefly concerned with <em>agents</em> or &lsquo;people in action&rsquo; which makes-up the object of poetry - its end. We are not elucidated precisely as to what &lsquo;people in action&rsquo; means other than these agents must be, in character, nobler or inferior to ourselves and, alternatively, better, inferior or similar people to ourselves. In the former Aristotle seems to mean that the ideals or choices of the character ought be higher or lower than ourselves and in the second he seems to mean that the quality of the human as a organism ought to be better, inferior or similar to ourselves. It here the concept of <em>ethos</em> (character) arrives not as those qualities which make-up your personality but rather those qualities that hinge on your moral character and the choices, through these, that you make.</p>
<p>A notable and surprising caveat of this definition of poetry is that it restricts the scope of poetics works to the life man. The myths of the divine or demigods is out of scope for Aristotle and does not fall within the purview of poetry. This immediately throws away a whole body of work we today think of Ancient Greek literature but would have been thought of in Aristotle&rsquo;s time as scripture. This restriction would also limit the scope such that works we would today consider &rsquo;lyric poetry&rsquo; fall beyond Aristotle&rsquo;s interest since the poet is a maker of agents which themselves necessarily emerge from <em>mythos</em> or plot. His reasons for doing this are not plain, but one would assume it is to make easier the job of constructing a systematic theory of mimesis rather than because he thinks these works are in and of themselves not mimetic.</p>
<p>In restricting the object of poetry Aristotle consequently restricts the medium of poetry to all those forms of mimesis that are capable of portraying agents and plot. To some extent this almost eliminates certain aspects of mimetic works we take for granted such as music of theatrical elements, but this is getting ahead of ourselves. What we see here Aristotle describing mimetic works as a relationship between ethos and action; how one&rsquo;s principles and choices in moments of action lead to particular outcomes and these outcomes are not arbitrary, in fact, Aristotle is quite clear in chapter 5 of his thesis that plots are constructed in accordance with probability.</p>
<p>It is this interplay between agents and medium that we discover the <em>mode</em> of a work, the <em>how</em> a mimetic work is represented. As Aristotle states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to imitate the same objects in the same medium sometimes by narrating (either using a different person, as in Homer&rsquo;s poetry, or as the same person without variation), or else with all the imitators as agents and engaged in activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Mode&rsquo; is an interesting word as it is so widely used yet so varyingly defined. In literary circles the &lsquo;mode&rsquo; of a work tends to indicate mood or character of a work and it seems this is the sense that Aristotle is using here. When he distinguishes comedy from tragedy by the representation of inferior agents in the former and superior agents in the latter he is distinguishing between their <em>mode</em> - their implementation and not merely their objects. A tragic work replaced with inferior agents would not make a comical work a tragic work.</p>
